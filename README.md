# SmartFlow Starter Project

This is the initial Spark AI assistant setup for SmartFlow.

## Folders
- `client/`: React frontend with Spark chat UI
- `server/`: Node.js backend with OpenAI integration

## Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your OpenAI API key.

2. Install server dependencies and run:

```bash
cd server
npm install
node spark.js
4. Scroll down and tap **Commit changes**

✅ Once this is done, your repo is fully set up and clean. Let me know, and we’ll move on to running Spark online from your phone using Replit (no computer needed). Ready when you are.
